# How AI is Transforming Healthcare: An Example of Analyzing the Relationship Between BMI and Cholesterol Levels

Using Python and Machine Learning to Gain Insights into Patient Health Status and Predict Health Outcomes

Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are transforming the healthcare industry. AI technologies, such as machine learning and natural language processing, can help healthcare professionals analyze patient data, predict health outcomes, and improve patient care. In this example, we demonstrate how AI can be used to analyze the relationship between BMI and cholesterol levels.

## Dataset

The code loads a healthcare dataset that includes patient information such as age, sex, race, height, weight, health status, heart attack, diabetes, rural or urban, region, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and cholesterol (CHOL) levels. The dataset is loaded using the pandas library and can be found in the 'NHANES.csv' file.
